House Price Prediction Web App:

A Machine Learning web application that predicts house prices based on user-provided inputs such as living area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
The application is built using Python, Linear Regression, and Streamlit, and is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

 Project Overview:

House price prediction is an important real-world problem in real estate.  
This application uses a **Linear Regression model** trained on housing data to estimate the selling price of a house based on:

- Living Area (square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms

Users can enter these values through a web interface and instantly get a predicted price.

 Machine Learning Details:

- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression  
- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning (Regression)  
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice`  

### Input Features:
- `GrLivArea` – Above ground living area (sq ft)
- `BedroomAbvGr` – Number of bedrooms
- `FullBath` – Number of full bathrooms

The model is implemented using **scikit-learn**.
